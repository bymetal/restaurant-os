# Architecture Decisions

## ADR-001 - Phase 0 Foundation

- Date: 2026-09-06
- Status: Accepted

### Context

The repository started as a product and architecture plan without executable
code. The first implementation needs a small foundation that keeps tenant
isolation, deterministic business logic, and durable side effects possible.

### Decision

Use a pnpm workspace with strict TypeScript, Fastify for the Core API,
PostgreSQL for durable state, Redis for transient infrastructure, Zod for
runtime boundary validation, and ordered SQL migrations. Keep provider
integrations behind adapter boundaries. The initial database foundation includes
business/branch membership, outbox events, idempotency keys, and audit logs.

The ORM choice remains open until the data-access layer is implemented. No
runtime AI or n8n business logic is introduced.

### Consequences

Phase 0 can be verified locally with Docker Compose and does not hide missing
provider credentials behind fake production claims. Later schema changes must be
new migrations, and architecture changes require another ADR.

## ADR-002 - Phase 1 Authentication

- Date: 2026-09-06
- Status: Accepted

### Context

Restaurant users need revocable sessions and platform/business role contexts
without trusting role claims or tenant IDs supplied by a client.

### Decision

Use short-lived HS256 access JWTs with fixed issuer/audience and a token version
checked against PostgreSQL on every authenticated request. Use opaque,
SHA-256-hashed refresh tokens with family rotation and reuse revocation. Store
passwords with Argon2id and keep the password hash, token version, role, and
permissions in the database. Refresh tokens are HttpOnly, Secure in production,
SameSite=Strict cookies.

### Consequences

Role changes, password changes, and tenant suspension can revoke active access
through a token-version bump. The database remains the source of truth for
authorization, while access tokens remain short-lived identity assertions.
